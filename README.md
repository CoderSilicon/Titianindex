RiskRadar

An AI-powered browser extension to detect malicious links and executable files in real-time.
Overview

This browser extension uses artificial intelligence to evaluate the risk of links and executable files. It provides users with a risk percentage to indicate how dangerous a link or file might be.

Features:

    Real-time risk assessment: Hover over a link on desktop to see its risk percentage.
    Mobile-friendly: Tap once to view the risk percentage, tap again to access the link.
    Executable file detection: Checks downloaded executable files for potential malware.
    User-friendly interface: Easy and clear visualization of risks without interrupting browsing.

How It Works

    The extension sends the URL or file metadata to an AI model.
    The AI model analyzes it based on trained features (e.g., URL structure, file signatures, known malware patterns).
    The extension displays a risk percentage:
        Green (0–30%): Safe
        Yellow (31–70%): Caution
        Red (71–100%): High risk

Mobile Behavior:
Since hovering is not available on mobile devices, clicking a link shows its risk percentage. Clicking a second time allows access to the link if the user chooses to proceed.
Installation

    Clone or download this repository.
    Load the extension in your browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox) as an unpacked extension.
    Enjoy safe browsing with AI-powered risk detection!
